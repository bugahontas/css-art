## âœ¨ *Behind the scenes*: artwork meaning

*EaD* is a Brazilian acronym for *EducaÃ§Ã£o a DistÃ¢ncia* (Distance Education or E-learning), that is, online classes. 

So, this artwork is a critic about common problems faced by many students and teachers, specially during the coronavirus pandemic, like stress, pains, technical problems and loneliness. 

In Brazil, the most used platform for online classes is Google Meet, in which each participant has your own avatar showing a personnal photo or simply the initial letter of your first name. 

Here, the artwork reproduces a Google Meet screen where each participant is a problem, and each of them has a initial letters that, together, form the expression *Estresse a DistÃ¢ncia* (Long-distance stress) instead of *EducaÃ§Ã£o a DistÃ¢ncia*. That's a well known and very funny pun here in Brazil! ðŸ˜‚
